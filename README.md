# Image-Classification-suing-AWS
The project oriented  to use AWS Sagemaker for making a pretrained model that can perform image classification on provided dog-breed dataset by using the Sagemaker profiling, debugger, hyperparameter tuning and other good ML engineering practices. This assignment is a part of AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program.  The are following tasks are done:      - Using as a model pretrained Resnet34 net from pytorch vision library is used in the project     - Fine-tuning the model with hyperparameter tuning and Network Re-shaping     - Implement Profiling and Debugging with hooks     - Deploy the model and perform inference
